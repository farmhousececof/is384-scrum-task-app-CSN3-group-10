## 2\. Scrum Events

We plan to simulate a 1-sprint workflow with the following events:

* **Sprint Planning**: A meeting at the start where the team selects tasks from the product backlog, defines the sprint goal, and creates the sprint backlog. (Simulated duration: 1 hour)
* **Daily Scrum**: Short daily stand-ups (15 minutes) where each member shares what they did yesterday, plan for today, and any blockers. (Simulated via group chat or quick calls)
* **Sprint Review**: At the end of the sprint, review what was "completed" (e.g., planned features) and demo the increment. (Simulated: 30 minutes to discuss outcomes)
* **Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting to reflect on what went well, what didn't, and improvements for next time. (Simulated: 30 minutes post-review)

## 3\. Scrum Artifacts

* **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of all features and tasks needed for the app (detailed in sprint-plan.md).
* **Sprint Backlog**: The subset of product backlog items selected for this sprint, broken into actionable tasks.
* **Increment**: The "done" work at the end of the sprint, such as updated plans or simulated features (in this assignment, it's the documented plans).
