# Sprint Plan

## 1. Product Backlog
Here are 5 prioritized tasks for the Task Management App:
- Add new task: Allow users to create a task with title, description, and due date.
- Assign task to user: Enable assigning tasks to specific team members via email or username.
- Mark task complete: Provide a way to update task status to "done" and log completion time.
- Display task list: Show a dashboard with all tasks, filtered by status or assignee.
- Notifications: Send alerts when a task is assigned or due.

## 2. Sprint Goal
The goal of this sprint is to plan the core features for task creation, assignment, and tracking, ensuring a basic functional outline for the cloud-based app that meets user needs for collaboration.

## 3. Definition of Done (DoD)
For a task to be considered "done" in this simulation:
- Code outline or plan is documented and pushed to the repository.
- Basic tests (e.g., unit test plans) are defined and pass in simulation.
- Documentation (e.g., how-to guides) is updated in the repo.
